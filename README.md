Bloom Academia

Bloom Academia is an AI-powered school designed to deliver mastery-based, one-on-one education at global scale. It transforms the proven effectiveness of personalized tutoring into a scalable system using a multi-agent AI architecture.



🚨 The Problem

-The world faces a 40+ million teacher shortage

-250 million children are out of school

-Traditional classrooms teach to the average student

-Learners advance by calendar, not by mastery

-One-on-one tutoring works (2-Sigma effect) but does not scale

-Education systems today cannot personalize learning at scale.



💡 The Solution

-Bloom Academia is not an AI tutor, it is a school system.

-Each learner is paired with personal AI teachers that:

-Teaches concepts step by step

-Adapts explanations in real time

-Assesses understanding continuously

-Enforces mastery before progression

-Remembers the learner across sessions

-This delivers elite one-on-one education without classrooms, teacher shortages, or physical infrastructure.




🧠 Core Architecture

Bloom Academia is built as a hierarchical multi-agent system:

Teaching Agents

Subject specialists (Math, Science, English, etc.)

Personalized instruction per learner

Multimodal output (voice, text, visuals)

-Coordinator Agent

Routes learner input intelligently

Maintains session continuity

Handles handoffs between agents

-Validator Agent

Independently verifies specialists output

Checks factual accuracy and curriculum alignment

Prevents hallucinations from reaching learners

-Assessor Agent

Conducts mastery-based assessments

Determines progression (system-controlled, not AI-claimed)



🧩 Mastery-Based Learning

Bloom Academia enforces true mastery:

Learners cannot advance without understanding

Incorrect answers trigger remediation

Progression is determined by the system, not the model

Learning gaps are detected and fixed immediately

This directly addresses Bloom’s 2-Sigma Problem at scale.




🗂️ Memory & Personalization

Bloom uses a 3-layer memory system:

Persistent learner profile (long-term)

Session history (short-term)

Lesson context (objective-level)

This enables long-term personalization, not stateless conversations.
